🔐 chmod Command Explained
chmod stands for change mode, and it's used in Linux to change the permissions of files and directories.

🧠 File Permissions Refresher
Each file has three sets of permissions:

User (u) – the owner

Group (g) – the group assigned to the file

Others (o) – everyone else

Each set can have:

r = read (4)

w = write (2)

x = execute (1)

You sum the numbers to set permission levels.

🔢 Numeric Mode

Permission	Number
r--	4
-w-	2
--x	1
rw-	6 (4+2)
rwx	7 (4+2+1)
So for chmod 755 file.txt:

7 (owner): rwx

5 (group): r-x

5 (others): r-x

✍️ Common Examples

chmod 400 file.txt   # Owner: read-only, others: no access
chmod 644 file.txt   # Owner: read/write, others: read-only
chmod 755 script.sh  # Owner: full access, others: read + execute
chmod +x script.sh   # Adds execute permission
chmod -w file.txt    # Removes write permission
